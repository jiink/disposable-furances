# Disposable Furnaces

_For smelting in a pinch!_

This mod adds several quick-smelting furnaces with no fuel slots. But once they are depleted, they burn themselves up and self-destruct.

This mod contains the following furnaces:

- Wooden Furnace
- Dried Kelp Furnace
- Charcoal Furnace
- Coal Furnace
- Blaze Furnace
- Lava Furnace (Getting a little silly there)
- Gunpowder Furnace (I know, gunpowder is not a fue- BOOM!)

This is my first Minecraft mod; don't hesistate to make an issue if there's something wrong.
